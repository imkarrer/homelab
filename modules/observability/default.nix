# L2 shared service: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana and the box's exporters.
#
# Lifted here from ac-host/modules/monitoring.nix in phase 8. That was the last
# layering violation left standing: a service every tenant depends on, owned by
# the repo of one tenant -- so disabling the racing stack took the metrics with
# it, and a dashboard change went through the racing tenant's release cycle.
#
# It stayed there through phases 1-7 for a concrete reason rather than inertia:
# the module reads two exporter scripts by relative path, so it could not be
# consumed as a flake output without them, and phase 1 needed a byte-identical
# closure while moving files necessarily changes store paths. Both scripts have
# come with it now, along with their tests and the Grafana dashboard, and the
# references changed from ../scripts/ to ./scripts/. Both are stdlib-only, so
# nothing else had to follow.
#
# Deliberately not bundled with moving the file: this used to declare its own
# Grafana firewall rule alongside homelab.tenants' identical one (beads
# homelab-bqo.30, fixed below) -- the observability tenant in
# hosts/ac-box/tenants.nix already knows every port this module opens or
# binds, so the contract is the single source of truth for what gets a
# firewall rule; this module's job is only to actually run the services at
# the addresses/ports the contract already knows about.
